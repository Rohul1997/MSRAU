# Metroid Samus Returns Amiibo Unlocker #

MSRAU is a tool used to edit your save to unlock amiibo only content on the Metroid Samus Returns.
It currently can only unlock the 3 Reserve Tanks.
I have plans to unlock the Fusion mode but may need help from others by dumping their completed save and possibly with Fusion mode unlocked.

### How to use ###
* Dump your saving using JKSM
* Copy the dumped save onto your PC
* Download MSRAU
* Run MSRAU
* Click the "Open" button and open the pkprfl.bmmssv file
* Click the "Unlock All 3 Reserve Tanks" button
* Your save should now have the content unlocked. 
* Now just import the save using JKSM
